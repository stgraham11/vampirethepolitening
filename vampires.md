# About Vampires

As the last rays of the flaccid Northern sun reach for me from a flat horizon, I arise in my blacked-out bedchamber from the day's slumber.  The smell of decay and the sound of chittering rats scampering in the dark surrounds me as I check the smartphone.  6 PM.  During the cold winters of these frozen plains, the end of the daywalking cattle's reign and the beginning of mine arrives delightfully early.  Truly a ble-

So wait, I was supposed to write about vampires.  I got going about my real life a little too hard there.  So You're a Vampire.  What's what mean?

## Caine's Curse and the Nature of Vampires

Vampires are supernatural monsters.  You hunger for blood - specifically human blood, although any will do if you're starving.  Sometimes, that hunger gets the better of you.  Your entire body runs on blood and magic.  Nothing else is required - you no longer have to eat, drink water, breathe, or maintain body heat to live.  To make more room for blood, you shat out all your non-heart organs shortly after becoming a vampire.  There's no going back now.  You're also a creature of darkness - direct exposure to flame and sunlight are incredibly deadly to you.  On the bright (?) side, outside of these things or complete destruction, *you're immortal*.

Vampires used to be people - no one is born a vampire.  The very first vampire was (the Biblical) Caine, cursed for his deeds.  Since then, vampirism has proliferated when vampires made other vampires out of humans, an intentional thing they do for a variety of reasons.  A vampire's 'generation' is how far removed they are from Caine (and the curse).  So, a 7th-generation vampire has Caine for a great-great-great-great grandsire, and is usually a pretty cold and scary individual.  A 2nd-generation vampire that has survived to modern nights is not recognizable as human, and can end you and all your friends with a thought.  Even a 'thin-blood' 13th-gen vampire can pick up a grown man bodily and throw him clear across a room.  As an added bonus, since you're missing almost all your organs, firearms don't work too well on you, either.

It is, inherently, a bummer to be a vampire - once the honeymoon period of being a nightstalking superhero wears off. You're not a person anymore, and even if people can't tell, you can't connect to them as if you were.  Love, sex, food, all pleasures of life are all replaced by predatory blood-drinking.  Vampires cannot have children, just create other vampires, and their art - while it can be excellent - is always lacking in creativity.  As they age, they become more powerful, but also more unwilling to change.  This utter inability to create is the final part of the curse; vampires are beings of decay.

This game is the story of your survival despite these harsh disadvantages.

## The Supernatural World of Darkness

Many events in history can be understood better once knowledge of the supernatural is in play.  For example, the time of the Spanish Inquisition, largely regarded among humans as a senseless orgy of overzealous slaughter, was as terrorized as Europe's vampires have ever been by anyone except each other!

The supernatural is real, although most people don't know that.  You probably figured that, being a vampire, but what if that's the only difference between the world and the 'party line?'  Well, it's not.  Changelings, sorcerers, mummies, ghosts, and more all exist.  As humans are diverse, and while only a scant few are aware of these creatures, there *are* human hunters of the supernatural.  Werewolves are of particular importance to you. As self-designated protectors of natural law, they're raised from birth on stories of how abominable you are and how dead you should be.

## Vampire Society

Because a violent 1v1 confrontation will tend to end well for the werewolf, vampires live secretly among humans - in cities for protection and food.  Vampires have learned to seem like people, and even more importantly, to use people as tools instead of risking their eternal selves.  The older the vampire, the harder it is to blend in, but the larger the social network will be!  Rural vampires exist, but it's risky as limited food restricts their numbers.

There is serious conflict between the need for safety from werewolves and the need for a consistent blood supply.  Vampires are naturally lone predators that prefer exclusive 'hunting grounds,' but information technology has come a long way since the Middle Ages, and any given country Count who made himself too obvious could be reported on and visited by ...persons... flown in from around the world in days.  So, to maintain secrecy, vampires form societies - but these societies, despite their outward fraternity, are very conservative, hierarchical and colored by the paranoia, secrecy, and selfishness of the monsters who construct them.  The shared traditions of these societies are as follows:

## The Traditions
* ### Masquerade
Thou shalt not reveal thy true nature to those not of the Blood.  Doing so shall renounce thy claims of Blood.

* ### Domain
Thy domain is thy concern.  All others owe thee respect while in it.  None may challenge thy word in thy domain.

* ### Progeny
Thou shalt sire another only with the permission of thine elder.  If thou createst another without thine elder's leave, both thou and thy progeny shalt be slain.

* ### Accounting
Those thou create are thine own childer.  Until thy progeny should be released, thou shalt command them in all things.  Their sins are thine to endure.

* ### Hospitality
Honor one another's domain.  When thou comest to a foreign city, thou shalt present thyself to the one who ruleth there.  Without the word of acceptance, thou art nothing.

* ### Destruction
Thou art forbidden to detroy another of thy kind.  The right of destruction belongeth only to thine elder.  Only the eldest among thee shall call the blood hunt.
